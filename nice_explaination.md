🏗️ The SWAI Cursor System: A Living 
  Architecture

  This is fundamentally a visual programming 
  environment for AI systems. Think of it as
  a combination of a circuit designer and a
  workflow orchestrator, but for AI modules.

  📄 The Foundation: YAML as Code

  At the bottom, modules/ contains YAML files
   that define AI components like Lego
  blocks:
  name: "text_processor"
  inputs: [{"type": "text", "description":
  "Raw input"}]
  outputs: [{"type": "processed_text",
  "description": "Cleaned text"}]
  dependencies: ["tokenizer", "cleaner"]
  status: "implemented"

  This isn't just configuration - it's a
  domain-specific language for describing AI
  workflows. Each YAML file is essentially a
  contract that says "I'm a black box that
  transforms X into Y, and I need these other
   boxes to work."

  🔍 The Validation Layer: Making Contracts 
  Enforceable

  loader.py is the contract enforcer. It
  doesn't just parse YAML - it validates
  that:
  - Every input/output has a clear type
  signature
  - Dependencies form a valid DAG (no
  circular madness)
  - Required fields are present
  - The AI system architecture makes logical
  sense

  This is crucial because in AI systems,
  garbage-in-garbage-out applies at the
  architectural level too.

  🧠 The Brain: Dependency Intelligence

  graph_builder.py is where the magic
  happens. It's not just drawing pretty
  pictures - it's solving the AI composition 
  problem:

  - Topological sorting: "If module A needs
  B's output, B must run first"
  - Cycle detection: "You can't have A→B→C→A
  because that's an infinite loop"
  - Level calculation: "These modules can run
   in parallel, these must be sequential"

  This enables automatic orchestration of
  complex AI pipelines just by declaring
  dependencies.

  🎭 The Execution Engine: Making It Real

  surrogate.py solves the development-time 
  problem: "How do you build an AI system
  when half the AI modules don't exist yet?"

  - Static stubs: Return fake data so you can
   test the plumbing
  - Mock LLM: Simulate AI responses for
  integration testing
  - Registry pattern: Swap implementations
  without changing the architecture

  This lets teams work in parallel - frontend
   devs can build UIs while AI engineers
  train models.

  🚀 The Orchestrator: Bringing It All 
  Together

  app.py is the system conductor. It provides
   the REST API that lets you:
  - Hot-reload YAML definitions (change
  architecture without restarting)
  - Execute AI workflows through surrogates
  - Validate new modules before they break
  existing pipelines
  - Query the dependency graph for impact
  analysis

  👁️ The Visual Brain: Making Complexity 
  Understandable

  The frontend components work together to
  solve the cognitive load problem of complex
   AI systems:

  GraphView.vue isn't just pretty pictures -
  it's a cognitive aid:
  - Visualize data flow through 50+ AI
  modules
  - Spot bottlenecks and parallelization
  opportunities
  - Understand ripple effects when changing a
   module

  ModuleStore.ts provides reactive 
  intelligence:
  - Real-time updates when modules change
  - Automatic dependency tracking
  - Pessimistic error handling for flaky AI
  services

  🔄 The Development Loop: Live AI 
  Architecture

  The watcher.py enables live architectural 
  development:
  1. Edit a YAML file defining an AI module
  2. System instantly validates and rebuilds
  the graph
  3. Frontend automatically shows the new
  architecture
  4. Test with surrogates before deploying
  real AI

  🎯 The Real Innovation: Visual AI 
  Composition

  This isn't just a pretty interface to a
  config system. It's solving the fundamental
   problem that AI systems are compositional 
  but composition is hard:

  - Visual dependency management: See how
  data flows through your AI pipeline
  - Interactive debugging: Click a module to
  see its inputs/outputs/status
  - Architectural refactoring: Drag-and-drop
  to restructure AI workflows
  - Impact analysis: Understand what breaks
  when you change something

  🚀 The Bigger Picture

  This system enables AI system architecture 
  as a first-class citizen. Instead of AI
  pipelines being buried in code, they
  become:
  - Visually comprehensible (graph view)
  - Declaratively defined (YAML)
  - Automatically validated (loader +
  graph_builder)
  - Incrementally testable (surrogates)
  - Hot-reloadable (watcher)

  It's essentially visual programming for AI,
   where the "programming" is defining how AI
   modules compose, and the "visual" part
  makes complex architectures actually
  manageable by humans.

  The dependency flow you see in the graph
  reflects this: data flows from declarative
  definitions → validation → orchestration →
  visualization → human interaction → back to
   definitions. It's a complete feedback loop
   for AI system development.
