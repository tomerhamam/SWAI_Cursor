- [X] Escape closes panels
- [X] Focus indicators are visible

### Screen Reader Support
- [X] Alt text on images/icons
- [X] Proper heading hierarchy
- [X] Descriptive button labels
- [X] ARIA labels where needed

## Error Handling

### Network Issues
- Stop backend server temporarily
- [X] Frontend shows appropriate error messages
- [X] No crashes or white screens
- [X] Graceful degradation

### Invalid Data
- [X] Handles malformed module data
- [X] Shows error states appropriately
- [X] Recovers when data is fixed

## Test Completion Checklist

### Core Functionality
- [X] Graph renders all modules correctly
- [X] Node selection works reliably
- [X] Module details panel functions properly
- [X] Performance meets 60 FPS target
- [X] No critical JavaScript errors

### User Experience
- [X] Interface is intuitive and responsive
- [X] Visual feedback is clear and immediate
- [X] Error messages are helpful
- [X] Loading states are appropriate
- [X] Keyboard navigation works

### Technical Quality
- [X] Code follows TypeScript best practices
- [X] Test coverage >90% for components
- [X] No memory leaks or performance issues
- [X] Browser compatibility confirmed
- [X] Accessibility requirements met

## Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue: Graph doesn't render**
- Check browser console for vis.js errors
- Verify data format from backend
- Check container dimensions

**Issue: Poor performance**
- Monitor browser performance tools
- Check for unnecessary re-renders
- Verify vis.js configuration

**Issue: Styling problems**
- Check CSS conflicts
- Verify responsive design
- Test different screen sizes

## Post-Testing Actions

If all tests pass:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Milestone 2 complete: Basic interactive visualization working"
git tag milestone-2-complete
echo "✅ Milestone 2 testing complete - Ready for Milestone 3"
```

If tests fail:
```bash
echo "❌ Milestone 2 testing failed - Review issues before proceeding"
# Document specific failures and screenshots
```

## Next Steps

After successful completion:
1. Document any UX observations
2. Note performance baselines
3. Plan advanced interaction features
4. Prepare for Milestone 3 testing
5. Begin Phase 4 development
