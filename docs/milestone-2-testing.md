# Milestone 2 Testing Script: Basic Interactive Visualization

**Duration**: 30 minutes  
**Focus**: Vue 3 frontend with vis.js graph rendering

## Pre-Testing Setup

```bash
# Start backend server
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
python -m flask run --debug &

# Start frontend development server
cd frontend
npm run dev &

# Open browser to http://localhost:5173
```

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Initial Load and Rendering (5 minutes)

**Visual inspection:**
- Open http://localhost:5173
- Observe graph rendering

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Application loads without errors
- [ ] Graph container is visible
- [ ] All existing modules appear as nodes
- [ ] Nodes have appropriate colors (green=implemented, yellow=placeholder, red=error)
- [ ] No JavaScript console errors
- [ ] Loading states are brief and informative

### 2. Node Interaction (10 minutes)

**Click interactions:**
- Click on different module nodes
- Verify module details panel appears
- Test clicking on different status modules

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Clicking a node selects it (visual feedback)
- [ ] Module details panel opens on the right
- [ ] Panel shows module name, description, status
- [ ] Panel shows inputs/outputs if present
- [ ] Panel shows dependencies if present
- [ ] Clicking outside deselects node
- [ ] Multiple clicks don't cause issues

### 3. Module Details Panel (10 minutes)

**Panel functionality:**
- Select various modules
- Review displayed information
- Test panel close functionality

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Panel displays all module metadata
- [ ] Version information shown when available
- [ ] Status displayed with appropriate color
- [ ] Close button (X) works correctly
- [ ] Panel is scrollable if content is long
- [ ] Typography is readable and properly styled

### 4. Performance Testing (5 minutes)

**Rendering performance:**
- Monitor browser performance tools
- Check for smooth animations
- Test with multiple rapid clicks

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Graph renders at 60 FPS
- [ ] No dropped frames during interactions
- [ ] Smooth transitions and animations
- [ ] No memory leaks in browser tools
- [ ] Responsive interactions (<100ms)

## Browser Testing

### Chrome
- [ ] Graph renders correctly
- [ ] Interactions work smoothly
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Performance is acceptable

### Firefox
- [ ] Graph renders correctly
- [ ] Interactions work smoothly
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Performance is acceptable

### Safari (if available)
- [ ] Graph renders correctly
- [ ] Interactions work smoothly
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Performance is acceptable

## Visual Quality Checks

### Graph Appearance
- [ ] Nodes are properly sized and positioned
- [ ] Colors match status (green/yellow/red)
- [ ] Text is readable on nodes
- [ ] Graph layout is logical and clear
- [ ] No overlapping elements

### UI Components
- [ ] Header displays correctly
- [ ] Theme toggle works (if implemented)
- [ ] Module panel has proper styling
- [ ] Responsive design works on different screen sizes
- [ ] Loading states are visually appropriate

## Accessibility Testing

### Keyboard Navigation
- [ ] Tab key navigates through interface
- [ ] Enter/Space activates elements
- [ ] Escape closes panels
- [ ] Focus indicators are visible

### Screen Reader Support
- [ ] Alt text on images/icons
- [ ] Proper heading hierarchy
- [ ] Descriptive button labels
- [ ] ARIA labels where needed

## Error Handling

### Network Issues
- Stop backend server temporarily
- [ ] Frontend shows appropriate error messages
- [ ] No crashes or white screens
- [ ] Graceful degradation

### Invalid Data
- [ ] Handles malformed module data
- [ ] Shows error states appropriately
- [ ] Recovers when data is fixed

## Test Completion Checklist

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Graph renders all modules correctly
- [ ] Node selection works reliably
- [ ] Module details panel functions properly
- [ ] Performance meets 60 FPS target
- [ ] No critical JavaScript errors

### User Experience
- [ ] Interface is intuitive and responsive
- [ ] Visual feedback is clear and immediate
- [ ] Error messages are helpful
- [ ] Loading states are appropriate
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works

### Technical Quality
- [ ] Code follows TypeScript best practices
- [ ] Test coverage >90% for components
- [ ] No memory leaks or performance issues
- [ ] Browser compatibility confirmed
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met

## Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue: Graph doesn't render**
- Check browser console for vis.js errors
- Verify data format from backend
- Check container dimensions

**Issue: Poor performance**
- Monitor browser performance tools
- Check for unnecessary re-renders
- Verify vis.js configuration

**Issue: Styling problems**
- Check CSS conflicts
- Verify responsive design
- Test different screen sizes

## Post-Testing Actions

If all tests pass:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Milestone 2 complete: Basic interactive visualization working"
git tag milestone-2-complete
echo "✅ Milestone 2 testing complete - Ready for Milestone 3"
```

If tests fail:
```bash
echo "❌ Milestone 2 testing failed - Review issues before proceeding"
# Document specific failures and screenshots
```

## Next Steps

After successful completion:
1. Document any UX observations
2. Note performance baselines
3. Plan advanced interaction features
4. Prepare for Milestone 3 testing
5. Begin Phase 4 development
