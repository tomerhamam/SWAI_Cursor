# Product Requirements Document (PRD) v2.0

## Product Title: Modular, Layered, and Interpretable AI System Architecture

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the design and specification for a robust, scalable software system that prioritizes **modularity**, **100% testability**, **human-auditable logic**, and **scalability to 500+ modules**. The architecture supports both manual and AI-delegated components, allows progressive disclosure of system internals, includes a visual interface for navigating hierarchical structures, and maintains bulletproof reliability through comprehensive testing.

The system's core innovation lies in combining agentic capabilities (LLMs, scripting, rule-based surrogates) with test-driven development principles and interactive visualization that scales from MVP to enterprise deployments.

- Allow functional simulation of incomplete modules via surrogates
- Support real-time collaborative editing with live updates

### Secondary Objectives

- Facilitate test-first design and incremental implementation
- Enable hierarchical expand/collapse for managing complexity
