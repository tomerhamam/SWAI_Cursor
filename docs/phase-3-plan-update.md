# Phase 3 Development Plan - Updated

## Pre-Phase 3 Improvements (Completed)

Before starting Phase 3, we've implemented the following improvements based on PR #3 review:

### 1. Code Quality Improvements ✅
- **Removed Debug Logs**: Cleaned up 18 console.log statements from GraphView.vue
- **Improved Error Handling**: Replaced console.error with proper store error handling
- **Production-Ready Code**: All debug code removed or gated behind development environment checks

### 2. Enhanced Test Coverage ✅
- **ModulePanel Tests**: Added 13 comprehensive unit tests covering all component functionality
- **StatusFilter Tests**: Added 11 unit tests for filtering logic and UI interactions
- **ContextMenu Tests**: Added 16 unit tests including keyboard navigation and accessibility
- **Total New Tests**: 40 unit tests added to frontend

### 3. Error Resilience ✅
- **Vue Error Boundary**: Created ErrorBoundary component with user-friendly error display
- **App-Level Integration**: Wrapped entire app in error boundary for global error catching
- **Enhanced Async Handling**: Updated all store methods with proper error handling
- **Development vs Production**: Different error display based on environment

### 4. Store Improvements ✅
- **Better Error Messages**: Consistent error handling across all async operations
- **New setError Method**: Allow components to set error state directly
- **Environment-Aware Logging**: Console errors only in development mode

## Phase 3: Advanced Interactivity Development

### Overview
Phase 3 focuses on implementing advanced interactivity features to make the system more powerful and user-friendly.

### Key Features to Implement

#### 3.1 Module Search and Filtering
- **Global Search**: Search across module names, descriptions, and metadata
- **Advanced Filters**: Filter by multiple criteria (status, dependencies, version)
- **Search Highlighting**: Highlight matching terms in results
- **Persistent Filters**: Remember user's filter preferences

#### 3.2 Batch Operations
- **Multi-Select**: Select multiple modules for batch operations
- **Bulk Updates**: Update status/properties for multiple modules
- **Bulk Delete**: Delete multiple modules with dependency checking
- **Selection UI**: Visual indicators for selected modules

#### 3.3 Import/Export Functionality
- **Export Modules**: Export selected modules to YAML archive
- **Import Modules**: Import modules from YAML files with validation
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle naming conflicts during import
- **Format Support**: Support single files and archives

#### 3.4 Undo/Redo System
- **Action History**: Track all user actions
- **Undo Stack**: Implement undo for create/update/delete operations
- **Redo Support**: Allow redoing undone actions
- **Visual Feedback**: Show what will be undone/redone

#### 3.5 Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Navigation**: Arrow keys for graph navigation (already implemented)
- **Actions**: Shortcuts for common operations (Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+S, etc.)
- **Search**: Ctrl+F for quick search
- **Help Modal**: Show available shortcuts (? key)

### Technical Considerations

#### State Management
- Implement action history in Pinia store
- Add selection state for multi-select
- Cache search results for performance

#### Performance
- Virtualize large module lists
- Debounce search input
- Optimize batch operations

#### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each new feature
- Integration tests for batch operations
- E2E tests for import/export workflows

### Implementation Order
1. **Search and Filtering** (High Priority)
   - Most requested feature
   - Enhances daily workflow
   
2. **Multi-Select and Batch Ops** (Medium Priority)
   - Builds on search functionality
   - Significant productivity boost
   
3. **Undo/Redo** (Medium Priority)
   - Safety net for users
   - Expected in modern apps
   
4. **Import/Export** (Low Priority)
   - Advanced feature
   - Useful for sharing/backup
   
5. **Keyboard Shortcuts** (Low Priority)
   - Power user feature
   - Can be added incrementally

### Success Metrics
- Search response time < 100ms
- Batch operations handle 100+ modules smoothly
- Zero data loss with undo/redo
- 95%+ test coverage maintained

### Timeline Estimate
- Search and Filtering: 2-3 days
- Multi-Select and Batch: 2-3 days
- Undo/Redo: 2 days
- Import/Export: 2 days
- Keyboard Shortcuts: 1 day
- Testing and Polish: 2 days

**Total: 11-13 days for complete Phase 3**

### Next Steps
1. Create detailed specifications for search UI
2. Design batch operation workflows
3. Implement action history architecture
4. Begin with search functionality
