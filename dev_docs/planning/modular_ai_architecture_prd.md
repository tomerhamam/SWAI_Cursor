# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Product Title: Modular, Layered, and Interpretable AI System Architecture

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the design and specification for a software system that prioritizes **modularity**, **human-auditable logic**, and **scalability** for AI-enhanced systems. The architecture supports both manual and AI-delegated components, allows progressive disclosure of system internals, and includes a visual interface for navigating a hierarchical structure of tasks, behaviors, and implementations.

The system's core innovation lies in combining agentic capabilities (LLMs, scripting, rule-based surrogates) with human-first architectural design principles derived from VLSI-style layering and hierarchical signal traceability.

## 2. Objectives

### Primary Objectives

- Support hierarchical modeling of AI-enhanced software systems.
- Enable zoom-in/zoom-out from high-level structure to detailed internals.
- Provide schema-based module documentation and integration contracts.
- Allow functional simulation of incomplete modules via surrogates.
- Support dynamic visualizations (block views, flowcharts, sequence diagrams).

### Secondary Objectives

- Facilitate test-first design and incremental implementation.
- Serve as a teaching and debugging tool.
- Improve collaboration and traceability in agentic or hybrid-AI systems.

---

## 3. Target Users

- AI-first product teams building multi-agent or modular workflows.
- Engineers integrating LLMs into conventional systems.
- Technical leads managing high-complexity software architecture.
- Researchers and educators aiming to document AI system behavior.

---

## 4. Product Features

### 4.1 Modular Block-Based Architecture

- Hierarchical blocks represent individual modules or systems.
- Each block contains metadata, interfaces, surrogate code (optional), and schema.

### 4.2 Living Schemas per Block

Each module includes a live, structured schema:

```yaml
module_name: Example Planner
inputs:
  - type: Pose
    description: Current vehicle state
outputs:
  - type: Trajectory
    description: Candidate path to goal
status: placeholder
implementation: rule-based
dependencies:
  - MapService
  - GoalSelector
```

### 4.3 Visual Representation Layer

- Collapsible block diagram for system hierarchy.
- Filterable views by status (implemented, stub, failing, etc.).
- Alternate views: execution flow, dependency graph, sequence diagrams.

### 4.4 Placeholder / Surrogate Execution

- Modules may include scripted or AI-generated placeholder behavior.
- Allows full-system simulation even with incomplete parts.

### 4.5 Filtering and Overlays

- View system by criticality, runtime frequency, implementation progress.
- Toggle between abstraction levels and diagram types.

---

## 5. MVP Scope

- A single-layer demo with 3–5 interconnected blocks.
- Each block includes a schema and stub logic (manual or LLM-based).
- Web-based UI with interactive visualization of block dependencies and states.
- YAML or JSON schema ingestion and rendering.

## 6. Success Metrics

| Metric                                | Target            |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| MVP prototype functional in-browser   | < 2 weeks         |
| User can define and render 5 modules  | Within 30 minutes |
| Block edit → UI update latency        | < 500ms           |
| Surrogate modules executed per second | > 10              |
| User satisfaction (pilot feedback)    | > 80% positive    |

---

## 7. Technical Considerations

- **Frontend**: HTML5 + D3.js for interactive visualization with force-directed layout.
- **Backend**: Python Flask for schema parsing and API endpoints.
- **Persistence**: Flat files (YAML/JSON) for module definitions.
- **Extensibility**: Designed to plug into agents (OpenAI, Claude, local LLMs).

---

## 8. Future Roadmap (Post-MVP)

- Live code editor integration per block (e.g., Monaco or VS Code embed).
- CI/CD hooks: test coverage, runtime tracing overlays.
- Model auto-suggestion for block completion.
- AI assistant integration for architectural suggestions.
- Plugin marketplace for common modules (e.g., FSM, PID, Planner).

---

## 9. Open Questions

1. How do we enforce contract compatibility across blocks?
2. What versioning system should be used for block schemas?
3. What’s the right fallback mode for broken or invalid modules?
4. How do we balance manual vs. auto-generated internals for agent blocks?
5. Should the tool eventually export runnable Dockerized services?

## Appendix: Glossary

- **Block**: A logical unit or module in the system (e.g., GoalSelector, SpeedProfiler).
- **Schema**: A structured metadata format describing each block's role, interfaces, and status.
- **Surrogate**: A placeholder module behavior (e.g., scripted logic or LLM call).
- **Hierarchical View**: Nested visual representation from top-level system to atomic components.
- **LLM Agent**: A language model component delegated with specific logic or generation task.
